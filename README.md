Original Description:
"The Type 63 Mortar in Far Cry 2 is a real pain to use on its own in far cry 2. Often in real life mortars are aimed using some form of projectile motion equations/ cheat sheets and what-not. Not to bash the developers, but I feel the mortar had a few drawbacks. To alleviate this, I have developed a simple python program to aim the mortar. I have sat a few hours trying to calibrate the numbers in the program such that the program scales the mouse movements to the game correctly"
